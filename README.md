# Barithone-virus
This is a very light version of the Winlocker-style virus, although there is only 1 option. In the peaceful version, it turns off the PC. In the extreme version, it deletes the system32 folder. This virus is an ideal option for pranking your friend.

I am not responsible for any damage caused to computers by users of my program. I am also not responsible for any loss of friendship after such pranks.


HOW TO USE

Peaceful version

download the file "Your file name (Paceful version)" (the file read me this is just to get the victim's attention don't do this tutorial) rename the file as you like, and rename the label fil as you like, so that your friend believes it, send it to him and make him run the label file by admin

(The password in stage 2 of the virus is really 1231)

Extreme version

download the file "Your file name (Extreme version)" (the file read me this is just to get the victim's attention don't do this tutorial) rename the file as you like, and rename the label fil as you like, so that your friend believes it, send it to him and make him run the label file by admin

(The password in stage 2 of the virus is really 1231)
